    <h1 class="ty">The Origin Story Of Computer</h1>
    <p class="tt">Computers started out way back when people were tired of doing math with pebbles.  Imagine sitting there for
         hours trying to figure out your grocery bill with a pile of rocks!  Not exactly fun. So, way back in the early 1800s,
         a guy named Charles Babbage (kind of sounds like a cartoon character, right?)
         was like, "There's gotta be a better way!"  He came up with this giant, crazy machine with gears and cranks 
         that could actually do calculations.  Think of it as a super fancy steam-powered calculator!  Although, it 
         was never actually built, this dude is considered the "father of computers" because he had the very first ideas.
        Fast forward a bit, and people started making these special machines to crack codes during World War II.  
        Top secret messages, whirring gears, flashing lights - it was like something out of a spy movie!  These machines
         were the ancestors of the electronic computers we know today.
        Of course, those early computers were HUGE and filled entire rooms.  It wasn't until much later that we got the
         mini computers, then the home computers, and then finally, the pocket-sized computers we all carry around today.
           So, from pebbles to smartphones, that's the wild journey of how computers came to be!</p>
