    <h1>Computer</h1>
    <h3> Definiton</h3>
    <p>
        A computer is like a smart machine that helps you do all sorts of things with information.<br>
         It can store data, process it really fast, and help you play games, do homework, or even chat<br>
         with friends.
        Imagine it as a super-fast and smart buddy! üñ•Ô∏è<br>
        But what really makes computers special is their ability to follow instructions, called programs<br>
         or software. These instructions tell the computer what to do, how to do it, and when to do it. This<br>
          software can be anything from a simple game to sophisticated business applications.</p>

    <h3>Component</h3>
    <p>
        A computer has essential parts called components. Some key ones are the central processing unit (CPU),<br>
         which thinks and calculates; memory (RAM), which stores data temporarily; storage, like a hard drive, for<br>
          long-term data; motherboard, connecting everything; and input/output devices, such as keyboard and monitor,<br>
           for communication. Each part plays a crucial role!</p>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>People use computers for a bunch of things! Students use them for homework, gamers for playing cool games,<br>
         and professionals for work stuff. You can watch movies, connect with friends, and find tons of information<br>
          online. Basically, it's like a super versatile tool that makes life easier and more fun! üåêüíª</p>
